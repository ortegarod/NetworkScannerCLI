# This file can be used for utility functions like:
# - More robust default interface and IP detection (e.g., using netifaces)
# - Advanced subnet calculations
# - Vendor lookup helpers if they become complex

# Example (currently implemented in scanner.py for simplicity):
# def get_default_interface_ip():
#     pass

# def get_subnet_from_ip(ip_address):
#     pass
